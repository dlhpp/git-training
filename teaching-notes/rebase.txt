-------- Rebase concept ---------

Rebase is a process

---------------------------------

// Interactive rebase master onto your checked out branch
git rebase -i master

<play the instructions, at this point the rebase stops>

<make changes, stage them, then commit them>

// Can continue the rebase like so
git rebase --continue

----------------------

git rebase -i master

<edit instructions, include squash for commits you want to combine>

<you will then be prompted for the NEW commit message (delete the ones you don't want)>

---------------------

git rebase -i master

<edit instructions, include "drop" for commits you want to combine>
