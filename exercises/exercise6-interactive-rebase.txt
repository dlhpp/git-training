Perform an Interactive Rebase:

Make a few related changes to index.html:
(make udpate)
git commit -m "message 1"
(make udpate)
git commit -m "message 2"
(make udpate)
git commit -m "message 3"

----------------------
SQUASH:
git rebase -i HEAD~3

<edit instructions, include squash for commits you want to combine>

<you will then be prompted for the NEW commit message (delete the ones you don't want)>
---------------------

(make udpate by adding a comment or log)
git commit -m "add logging"
(make udpate)
git commit -m "message 2"
(make udpate by adding a comment or log)
git commit -m "added more logging"

---------------------
DROP:
git rebase -i master

<edit instructions, include "drop" for the logging commits>

---------------------
Rebase against master branch:

// Interactive rebase master onto your checked out branch
git rebase -i master

<play the instructions, at this point the rebase stops>

<make changes, stage them, then commit them>

// Can continue the rebase like so
git rebase --continue
